# simplenote.vim
A vim plugin to interact with the [simplenote][1] API. You can create an
account [here](https://simple-note.appspot.com/create) if you don't already
have one.
Now you can take simple notes directly from your favourite editor.

## Installation
Just copy `simplenote.vim` into your plugin folder. But you really want to use
[pathogen][5] for your plugin management.

Your credentials have to be stored in your `vimrc`:

    let g:SimplenoteUsername = "your simplenote username"
    let g:SimplenotePassword = "your simplenote password"

If you don't want to have the credentials in your `vimrc` (if you manage it
with git for example), you can just set the variables in a different file (like
`~/.simplenoterc`) and source it with `source ~/.simplenoterc` in your `vimrc`.

## Usage
The plugin provides several commands to interact with your Simplenote account.
In order to retrieve a list of your notes execute

    :Simplenote -l X

Where X is the number of notes to retrieve; omit X to retrieve all. 
This opens a new scratch buffer with a line-wise listing of your notes. You can
navigate through these with the arrow keys and enter a note on hitting
`Return`. Now that you see the content of the note, you can interact with this
specific note:

    :Simplenote -u

updates the content of the current note with the content of the current buffer.
If you want to delete the note, execute

    :Simplenote -d

This moves the current note to the trash. If you want to completely delete a
note, use

    :Simplenote -D

as it will directly delete the note and not only move it to the trash.
There also exists a command to create new notes.

    :Simplenote -n

creates a new note with the contents of the current buffer. Once the note is
created, `:Simplenote -u` updates the newly created note, also with the
contents of the current buffer.
Tagging notes is also supported. If you enter

    :Simplenote -t

on a buffer containing a valid note, you get an input dialog, prefilled with
existing comma-separated tags for the note, which you can then edit. Tags have
to be comma separated and hitting `Enter` will then update the note with the
new tag list.

## Dependencies
Version 2 of the SimpleNote API relies heavily on JSON. As JSON and VimL don't
really play nice together, basic parts of this plugin are implemented in
python. Therefore your vim has to be compiled with python support in order to
use this plugin.

## Usage behind proxy
Since the plugin uses Python's urllib2 for making HTTP requests, you just have to
add these lines (with the correct values) to your `.vimrc`:

    let $HTTP_PROXY = 'http://<proxyuser>:<proxypassword>@<proxyurl>:<proxyport>'
    let $HTTPS_PROXY = 'http://<proxyuser>:<proxypassword>@<proxyurl>:<proxyport>'
